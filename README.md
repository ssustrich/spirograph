I've loved the idea of SpriographÂ® drawings, I just hate the physical part of it. 
My drawings never came out looking like the ones on the box, my pens would stink, or
a disk would slip and jerk etc.

Then I took a lot of mathematics classes and became a software developer. Not suprisingly
you don't need the physical toy, in fact the physical toy is very limited. What if I want the 
color to change over time smoothly, or what it I want a point on the disk that rotates on the
ring that is actually outside the radius of the disk? What if I want more than one disk, what if
I want disks in rings going around disk each a different direction?

Animating graphics in java is a bit of a pain, luckily the nice folks at https://processing.org/
have made a nice wrapper/abstarction layer for nothing but animations in java. Now I have a nice
executable jar that will let me draw all sorts of nice [Roulette curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roulette_(curve))
They were also nice enough to make thier wrapper lgpl so that I can bunle it with my jar and host it here.
